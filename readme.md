## About KDG Aggregator

This app is for KDG employees to enter their time entries instead of jotting it down on paper throughout the day. As entries are entered, the app will aggregate them according to Project and Task, totaling the hours entered. The employee can then hit sync or sync-all, and the entries will get sent to Zoho Projects.

## How to Use

Enter your time in the "Add a Time Entry" form on the Work Done page and hit sync or sync-all when you're ready to post your entries to Zoho Projects. On the Projects page, you can enable which of your active projects you would like to be displayed in the projects select box on the Work Done page.

## Before Using

Before the app is ready to use, you must first generate an auth token. The app will not permit you to view the Work Done or Projects pages until you have an auth token. Directions on how to generate an auth token will be displayed on first use of the app.
